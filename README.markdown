Kaleidoscope
============

**Simple** and **clean** object factories for ActiveRecord objects.

Kaleidoscopes are ridiculously simple objects, and they provide us with
beautiful images with almost no work on our part.

Example plz?
------------

    Kaleidoscope.define do
      factory(User) {{ :name => "Foo Bar", :email => "foo@bar.com", :password => "test" }}
      factory(User, :admin) {{ :admin => true }}
      factory(User, :named) do
        lambda {|name| { :conditions => { :name => name }}}
      end
    end
    
    User.factory.create #=> #<User id: 1, name: "Foo Bar", email: "foo@bar.com", password: "test", admin: false>
    User.admin.create #=> #<User id: 2, name: nil, email: nil, password: nil, admin: true>
    
    # Overwriting values
    User.factory.create(:name => "foca") #=> #<User id: 3, name: "foca", email: "foo@bar.com", password: "test", admin: false>
    
    # Don't save values automatically
    User.factory.new #=> #<User id: nil, ...>

Generating unique values
------------------------

Most of the time, our models require certain fields to have unique content. In 
order to generate that with Kaleidoscope, just call `Kaleidoscope.unique`:

    Kaleidoscope.unique #=> 0
    Kaleidoscope.unique #=> 1
    # and so on, and so forth
    
If you need repeatable values, call `Kaleidoscope.reset_uniques!` and the next
call to `Kaleidoscope.unique` will return 0 again.

You can pass a block to `unique`, in which case we will pass the unique value
to the block and return whatever the block outputs:

    Kaleidoscope.unique {|i| "user_#{i}" } #=> "user_0"

How does it work?
-----------------

It just uses named scopes behind the scenes. Each factory declaration defines
a new named scope with the provided name (or `factory` by default).

This means we don't touch *any* class. No methods are added on 
`ActiveRecord::Base`. 

If the named scope already exists (or you have a class method with that
same name), the factory declaration will fail with an `ArgumentError`.

But enough README, read the code, the factory declaration is 5 lines of code.
Literally.

Why?

Just a thought experiment, but it might turn out to be useful after all. All
